# 11-note-taker
This is the week 11 Homework

1.0 Title: Note Taker

2.0 Introduction:

    The goals of this week homework was to take the starting front in, the html, css, and index.js files and create a backend
    that will give the website it's desired function. The ability to type in a note, and have it save and exist in a .json file.
    Also local data should not be used, like in the week 5 homework daily planner.

3.0 Technologies:

    For this assignment I used Javascript, expliclity node.js, and the npm modules express and nanoid.

4.0 Launch:

    The repo is located here: https://github.com/speakeasyman/11-note-taker
    The note taker was launched on heroku located here: https://peaceful-forest-99866.herokuapp.com/

5.0 My goals:

    The main goal was to get one that was working. The trickiest problem was I ran into an error from
    how I initially set up the branches. I had to change that a few times for it to work better.

6.0 In use:

    Install node, and do your npm to add express and nonoid. When it runs you'll see the default homepage.
